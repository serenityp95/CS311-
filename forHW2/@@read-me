HW2 INSTRUCTIONS:

First, read the assignment sheet throughly.

Run my demo programs first and observe the results.

All you need is one client file with the required function AND main.

Must complete the ** parts of: 
  binsearch.cpp
  partition.cpp
  combine.cpp

Do not forget the required comments.

Do not create header and implementation files.

-----------------------
Using HW2demos you can test to see if your functions
work with QuickSort and MergeSort.
