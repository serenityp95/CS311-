HW5 INSTRUCTIONS:

Read the assignment sheet thoroughly first.

Use my header file and the client file.

Complete the implementation file.

Check my hw5.out to make sure you produce the
same results.  Note that my hw5.out displays
the jobs in a tree format so prove to you that
it is a heap tree.  You do not have to do that.
